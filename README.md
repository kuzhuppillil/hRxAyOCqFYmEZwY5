## Data Description

The dataset has undergone careful data cleaning to protect personal information. Each candidate is represented by a unique identifier and several attributes.

## Attributes:

    id: A unique numerical identifier for each candidate.
    job_title: The job title associated with the candidate.
    location: The geographical location of the candidate.
    connections: The number of connections a candidate has, where "500+" implies more than 500 connections.

## Output (Desired Target):

    fit: This numeric value represents how suitable a candidate is for a specific role, ranging from 0 to 1.

## Keywords:

    We are interested in candidates expressing interest in human resources, which can be indicated by the presence of the keywords "Aspiring human resources" or "Seeking human resources."

## Goal(s)

Our primary goal is to predict the fitness of a candidate for a particular role, as represented by the fit variable.

## Success Metric(s)

To assess the success of our model, we will:

    Rank Candidates: We aim to rank candidates based on a fitness score, making it easier to identify the most suitable candidates.

    Re-rank Candidates: We will re-rank candidates when a candidate is "starred" to account for new information or actions.

## Bonus(es)

We are also interested in exploring the following aspects:

    Filtering Candidates: How can we efficiently filter out candidates who should not be on this list in the first place?

    Universal Cut-off Point: Is it possible to determine a cut-off point that works effectively for various roles without excluding high-potential candidates?

    Bias Mitigation: Can we develop automated procedures to reduce human bias in the candidate selection process?

Our objective is to build a robust algorithm that not only predicts candidate fitness but also adapts to changes and promotes fairness and efficiency in the selection process.
